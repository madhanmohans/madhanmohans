```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# setting readme_PATH to the path of the cloned repo
readme_PATH=<PATH OF THE CLONED REPO> 

# changing directory to readme_PATH
cd $readme_PATH 

# first, pulling from remote repo to avoid conflict 
git pull 

# gives the number of lines of the output of 'git diff origin/main' command
CHANGES_EXIST=$(git diff origin/main | wc -l) 

# exits the script if there are no changes
if [ $CHANGES_EXIST -eq 0 ]; then 

exit 0

fi

# activating the virtual environment
. chess/bin/activate 

# Removing the last 23 lines (the chart)
head -n -23 README.md > tmp.txt && mv tmp.txt README.md 

# Run the python script, and append the output(chart) to README.md
python3 chess-rating/rating_chart.py >> README.md; 

# Pushing to github with commit message being date and time of commit
git add .; git commit -q -m "Updated on `date +'%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S'`"; git push origin main -q 
```
